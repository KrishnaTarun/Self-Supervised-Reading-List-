## Reading List

This is repository contains the reading list for Self-Supervised Learning (and related literature). Well these are the papers that I have read so far and its a list just to keep track of that.

### Acronyms

- **C**ontrastive **L**earning : CL
- **K**nowledge **D**istillation : KD 
- **D**eep **Cl**ustering: DCL
- **S**tudent **T**eacher: ST
- **S**iamese **L**earning: SL
